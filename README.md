# Student Management System

This project is a **C++ Student Management System** that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records. The application uses binary file handling to store and manage student data.

## Features

1. **Create Student Record**: Add a new student with details like roll number, name, and marks in various subjects.
2. **Search Student Record**: Search for a specific student by roll number.
3. **Display All Records**: View all stored student records.
4. **Modify Student Record**: Update details of an existing student.
5. **Delete Student Record**: Remove a student record by roll number.

## How It Works

1. **Input**:
   - User provides the student's roll number, name, and marks for 5 subjects (English, Math, Science, 2nd Language, Computer Science).

2. **Grade Calculation**:
   - Average marks are calculated and a grade is assigned:
     - `A` for 90 and above
     - `B` for 75 to 89
     - `C` for 50 to 74
     - `F` for below 50

3. **Storage**:
   - Records are stored in a binary file (`student.dat`) using file I/O operations.

4. **Menu Options**:
   - **1**: Add a new student record.
   - **2**: Search for a student using the roll number.
   - **3**: Display all records.
   - **4**: Delete a student record.
   - **5**: Modify a student's details.
   - **6**: Exit the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **File Handling**: Binary file I/O

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Visual Studio)
- Basic understanding of C++ and file handling
